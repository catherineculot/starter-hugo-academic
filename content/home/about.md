Hi ! I am a Brussels-based Post-doc researcher with expertise in cognitive psychology and health psychology. 

I obtained my Ph.D. in the Center for Research in Cognition and Neurosciences (ULB) supervised by Dr Wim Gevers. I conducted my PhD research on the influence of emotional states and disorders on metacognitive performance using a combination of techniques (EEG, EMG, TMS). More broadly, I am interested in understanding the role of emotions and interoception in metacognition and decision-making. \
I am currently working as a Post-Doc researcher in the Research Center for the Promotion of Health, Prosocial Behavior and Wellbeing (ULB), headed by Dr Ann DeSmet.
